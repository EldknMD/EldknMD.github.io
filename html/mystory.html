        <p> Nothing interesting. Were kinda known in my town for being quite smart (still nowadays I can't figure what I did to achieve that).</p>
        <p>My school years were kinda weird. For diverse circumstances, I had to go to another city to study. Because that, I've always was the foreign kid. I made good friends there, anyways.</p>
        <p>I fell in love with science and logical procceses while I was a child. I choose human medicine as my profession and started coding as a hobby few years later.</p>
