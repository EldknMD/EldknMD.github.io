        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Birthday: January 23th 19??</p>
        <p>Birthplace:A modest hospital in one of the hundreds of cold and wet cities in the coast from southern Chile</p>
        <p>First years: Nothing interesting. Were kinda known in my town for being quite smart (still nowadays I can't figure what I did to achieve that).</p>
        <p>My school years were kinda weird. For diverse circumstances, I had to go to another city to study. Because that, I've always was the foreign kid. I made good friends there, anyways.</p>
        <p>I fell in love with science and logical procceses while I was a child. I was the kind of boy who played with insects and rocks instead play with others. Don't misunderstand me, I wish I hadn't been so introverted.</p>
        <p>Resume: Superb student, bad at anything else.</p>
