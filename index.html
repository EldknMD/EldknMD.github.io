<h1>Hello! Welcome to EldknMD's. Feel like you're at home.</h1>
<p>I'm a chilean boy, computer enthusiast and medical student!</p>
<p>I love to read. My favorite genres are scientific publications about biology and latinamerican magic realism.</p>
<p>I'm also an amateur writer, since I was 9 years old. I don't write too much human language nowadays, but I've got a couple ideas for stories and other creative means.</p>
<p>Also love to play videogames. My favorites are Pok√©mon franchise and a lot of RTS games. But, my favorite game of all time is Age of empires 2.</p>
<p>Started coding almost a year ago, and my current portfolio isn't too much but something interesting.</p>
<p>My journey started with Discord community chat bots, coded on Javascript and hosted online 24/7 on many servers.</p>
<p>My favorite and main computer language is, as you see, Javascript, but I also know a bit about HTML, CSS and a couple of database systems, like MongoDb and SQL.</p>
<p>Wanna talk? Find me on <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> as EldknMD#4471 </p>
<p>I'm hosted thanks to GitHub School program.</p>
